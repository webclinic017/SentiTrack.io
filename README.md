# Real-Time-Sentiment-Tracker

A tool to track WallStreetBets' "general" market sentiment in real time. Use the data to make better or worse investing decisions. Happy gambling and I do not take any responsibilty for any bad trades made using this data =) ğŸš€ğŸš€ğŸš€ğŸš€ğŸš€

Edit the fetch time to explore different time granularities (default is 5 minutes). Note that weekend threads are slower and a greater time resolution will work best.
