# Real-Time-Sentiment-Tracker

A tool to track general market sentiment and performance over time. Use the data to make better or worse investing decisions. Happy gambling and I do not take any responsibilty for any bad trades made using this data =) ğŸš€ğŸš€ğŸš€ğŸš€ğŸš€

# How to Run

    pip install -r requirements.txt

    python3 src/main.py

Edit the fetch time to explore different time granularities (default is 5 minutes). Note that weekend threads are slower and a greater time resolution will work best.
